# Justin Hancock
### Cybersecurity Enthusiast & Developer in Training

I am actively developing skills in security, development, and system administration through hands-on projects. My passion lies in understanding how technology works from the ground up, because I believe the best way to secure a system is to know how to build it.

This portfolio documents my learning journey and showcases the practical examples of my work.
