# Linux-Lab (Your Personal Lab for making mistakes and not crying about it)
((work from command line for the practice and have the GUI as back up if we get stuck))

- We will set up a basic computer
- Install ubuntu linux
- Get ourselves online
- Use command line/terminal to update and install needed programs
- Use the new computer for something useful (Media Server)
- Set it up for networking practice and review
