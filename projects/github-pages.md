### **Project Tutorial: Building Your Professional Portfolio with GitHub Pages & VS Code or another IDE**

**Objective:** To build a free, professional, and fully customizable portfolio website using the "Just the Docs" theme on GitHub Pages. This guide uses the standard developer workflow: setting up a local development environment with Git and Visual Studio Code to gain practical command-line experience.

**Skills Demonstrated:** `Git`, `GitHub Pages`, `Markdown`, `YAML`, `VS Code`, `Command-Line Interface (CLI)`, `Technical Documentation`

---

### **Phase 1: The Foundation - One-Time Setup**

Before we start building, we need to set up our professional toolkit. This is a one-time process that will serve you for your entire career.

#### **Step 1: Install the Essential Tools**

1.  **Git:** Git is the version control system that tracks changes to your code. If you don't have it, download and install it from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/downloads). Accept the default settings during installation.
2.  **Visual Studio Code (VS Code):** This will be our code editor, or IDE. It's the industry standard for its power and flexibility. Download it from [code.visualstudio.com](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

#### **Step 2: Configure Git with Your Identity**

After installing Git, you must tell it who you are. This information will be attached to every change you make. Open your command prompt (Terminal on Mac/Linux, Git Bash on Windows) and run these two commands, replacing the placeholders with your information:

```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "youremail@example.com"
```
*(Use the same email you used for your GitHub account.)*

---

### **Phase 2: Building the Site - From GitHub to Your Local Machine**

Now we'll create the live website on GitHub and bring a copy down to our computer to work on.

#### **Step 3: Create the Live Repository from the Template**

1.  Navigate to the **[Just the Docs Template Repository](https://github.com/just-the-docs/just-the-docs-template)**.
2.  Click the green **"Use this template"** button and select **"Create a new repository"**.
3.  On the "Create a new repository" page, configure the following:
    *   **Repository name:** This is the most critical step. Name it **exactly** `your-username.github.io`. (e.g., if your username is `jdoe`, the repo is `jdoe.github.io`).
    *   **Description:** "My Cybersecurity Portfolio" or a similar professional summary.
    *   **Public/Private:** Ensure it is set to **Public**.
4.  Click **"Create repository"**.

#### **Step 4: Clone the Repository to Your Local Machine**

"Cloning" means creating a local copy of the remote repository on your computer.

1.  On your new repository's GitHub page, click the green **`< > Code`** button.
2.  Ensure the **HTTPS** tab is selected and click the **copy icon** next to the URL.
3.  Open your terminal and navigate to a directory where you want to store your projects (e.g., `cd Documents/Projects`).
4.  Run the `git clone` command, pasting the URL you copied:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-username.github.io.git
    ```
5.  A new folder named `your-username.github.io` will be created. Navigate into it:
    ```bash
    cd your-username.github.io
    ```

#### **Step 5: Open the Project in VS Code**

With your terminal still in the project directory, run this command to open the entire folder in VS Code:
```bash
code .
```
*(The `.` is shorthand for "the current directory".)*
You will now see the entire file structure of your new website in the left-hand sidebar of VS Code.

---

### **Phase 3: The Workflow - Edit, Commit, Push**

This is the core loop of professional development. We will make a change, save a "snapshot" of that change (commit), and then upload it to GitHub (push) to make it live.

#### **Step 6: Configure Your Site in `_config.yml`**

The `_config.yml` file is the main control panel for your website.

1.  In VS Code, find and open the `_config.yml` file.
2.  Make the following edits. **Crucially, remember to wrap any values that contain special characters (like a colon `:`) in quotes.**
    ```yaml
    # Add quotes around the title because it contains a colon
    title: 'Your Name: Cybersecurity Portfolio'
    description: 'A collection of my hands-on projects and skills.'
    
    # This should already be set, but verify it
    theme: just-the-docs
    
    # This URL is automatically generated by GitHub, but setting it is good practice
    url: https://your-username.github.io
    ```
3.  Save the file (`Ctrl+S` or `Cmd+S`).

#### **Step 7: The First Commit & Push**

Now, let's send this change to GitHub using the command line.

1.  Open the integrated terminal in VS Code (**View > Terminal** or **Ctrl+`**).
2.  **Stage your changes:** This prepares your modified files for saving.
    ```bash
    git add .
    ```
3.  **Commit your changes:** This saves the snapshot with a descriptive message explaining what you did.
    ```bash
    git commit -m "Configure initial site title and description"
    ```
4.  **Push your changes:** This uploads your committed changes from your computer to the `main` branch on GitHub.
    ```bash
    git push
    ```

#### **Step 8: Set Permissions and Go Live!**

There's one final one-time setup step on GitHub to allow the site to build.

1.  Go back to your repository on the GitHub website.
2.  Go to **"Settings" > "Actions" > "General"**.
3.  Scroll to "Workflow permissions", select **"Read and write permissions"**, and click **Save**.
4.  Now navigate to **"Settings" > "Pages"**.
5.  Under "Build and deployment", ensure the **Source** is set to **"Deploy from a branch"** and the branch is `main`.
6.  You should see a message at the top saying, "Your site is live at `https://your-username.github.io`". It may take 2-5 minutes to build the first time.

### **Troubleshooting & Debugging**

Your site didn't update or you got an error? Don't panic. This is a normal part of the process.

**Step 1: Check the Build Action**
*   In your GitHub repository, go to the **"Actions"** tab.
*   Look at the latest workflow run. Is it a **Green Checkmark (✅)** or a **Red X (❌)**?

**Step 2: If the Build FAILED (Red ❌)**
*   A failed build is almost always a syntax error in a `.yml` or `.md` file.
*   Click on the failed run, then click the `build` job on the left.
*   Scroll through the log and look for the error message in red text. It will often tell you the exact file and line number that caused the problem.
*   **Common Cause:** A missing space after a colon in a YAML file (e.g., `title:My Site` instead of `title: My Site`) or improperly formatted Front Matter.
*   Fix the error in VS Code, then `git add .`, `git commit -m "Fix build error"`, and `git push` again.

**Step 3: If the Build SUCCEEDED (Green ✅) but you don't see changes**
*   The issue is almost certainly browser caching. Your browser is showing you an old version of the site.
*   **Solution:** Perform a "hard refresh" by pressing **`Ctrl+Shift+R`** (Windows/Linux) or **`Cmd+Shift+R`** (Mac).
*   **Alternative Cause:** A logical error in your Front Matter. Double-check that `parent:` and `grand_parent:` values in your page files exactly match the `title:` of their intended parent pages (it's case-sensitive!).

By following this workflow, you are not just building a website; you are practicing the fundamental skills of a modern technology professional.
