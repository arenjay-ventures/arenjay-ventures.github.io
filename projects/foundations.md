# Foundations (Git, Linux, Python, AI, Home-Lab, AWS)

These projects represent the foundational skills I developed while studying for my initial certifications. They cover core concepts in networking, Linux, and basic security tooling.

Some important notes on learning for those that follow.
You HAVE to start somewhere and almost every general tutorial will assume you have knowledge of some other subject you havn't touched yet.

If starting with code but not knowing how to navigate an IDE or to use Git or the command line will make it 10x harder than it needs to be.
So I will try to organize all of the extreme basics here so when stuck you can move forward without completely stopping to learn a new subject.
In time, you will use the same basics over and over and then can step into becoming more proficient with the underlying skills as well.

**GOOD LUCK AND ENJOY**
