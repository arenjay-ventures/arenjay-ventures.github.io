# About Me

### My Mission

My goal is to be a leader in securing the automated and intelligent systems that will define our future. I am passionate about understanding how complex technologies work: from cloud infrastructure to blockchains to AI Deployments, not just to build them, but to defend them effectively.

### My Journey

My path to cybersecurity is built on a foundation of analytical problem-solving, systems thinking, and customer-focused operations. This background gives me a unique perspective on `[mention a benefit, e.g., "understanding business risk," "communicating technical concepts to non-technical stakeholders," "managing complex projects"]`.

Driven by a desire to tackle more dynamic and impactful challenges, I pivoted into technology, focusing intensely on the areas where security is most critical: cloud infrastructure, automation, and emerging AI systems. I am a dedicated lifelong learner, constantly expanding my skillset through hands-on projects and formal certifications.

### Core Skillset

*   **Offensive Security:** Proficient with tools like Nmap, Metasploit, and Burp Suite for network and web application penetration testing. Focused on identifying and mitigating vulnerabilities before they can be exploited.
*   **Cloud & Systems Engineering:** Experienced in designing, deploying, and hardening Linux-based systems and virtualized environments. Skilled in using AWS for scalable infrastructure and applying Infrastructure as Code principles with Terraform.
*   **Security Operations & Automation:** Capable of analyzing logs and network traffic to detect threats, and proficient in scripting with Python and Node.js to automate repetitive security tasks and build custom tools.

I am currently seeking opportunities where I can apply my unique blend of analytical and technical skills to help a forward-thinking organization build and secure innovative technologies.
